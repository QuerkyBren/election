            <h2>How do you know what nation I am?</h2>
            <p>NationStates allows for third-party websites to verify whether or not you are logged in as a certain nation, using a special access code. We do not get any access or information of your nation besides your login status.</p>
            <h2>How are the votes accountable?</h2>
            <p>All vote records are logged using Firebase, a data storage service for web apps by Google. Firebase frequently does backups on vote data, as well as provides us with an unmodifiable log of vote changes (through citizens voting, decisions made by the Minister of Justice or new elections created by government officials). This log records which user did what at a certain time and from what IP address.</p>    
            <p>Additionally, all of the code of the website that facilitates this database and website is open source and can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/VersutianFederation/">GitHub</a>. Changes to the code by any developer are recorded there using git, and the history of changes can not be modified.</p>
            <h2>Why is a new site necessary?</h2>
            <p>A specialized website designed for Versutian elections ensures that the voting process is accountable, accessible and easily managed. Although forums do provide for polling functionality, more features to the voting process can be added through a special site.</p>
            <h2>You didn't answer my question.</h2>
            <p>The developer of this site, mastercoms or better known in the Versutian Federation as Humantus, can be reached at circuitsoft [at] tuta [dot] io, or on Discord @mastercoms if you have any more questions or comments.</p>
